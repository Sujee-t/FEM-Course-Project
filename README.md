This report presents the finite element analysis of a two-dimensional steady-state heat 
conduction problem in a square steel plate with 1 m × 1 m dimensions. The plate is subjected 
to a localized heat source of 1 kW at its center. The analysis is done using linear triangular 
elements with varying levels of mesh refinement to examine the effect of discretization on the 
accuracy of the temperature distribution. 
Two different cases of boundary conditions are considered: 
Case 1: Three sides of the plate are insulated, while the fourth is maintained at a constant 
temperature of 25°C. 
Case 2: Three sides of the plate are insulated, and the fourth side is subjected to convective 
heat transfer with a fluid at 25°C. 
The temperature distribution is calculated for different mesh configurations, and contour 
plots, along with temperature profiles, are used to compare the solutions' accuracy and 
behavior.
